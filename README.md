# Mojave Dyanmic Wallpaper for KDE

**These images/wallpapers are fully owned by Apple and not owned by me!**

## What does it work with?
I've confirmed it to work with the plasma5-wallpapers-dynamic plugin, on KDE Plasma 5.
This wallpaper uses a Solar configuration so it may work with other plugins, but I have not tested those.

## Installation
As of now, you will need access to sudo or root.

Install the wonderful plasma5-wallpapers-dynamic plugin by zzag: https://github.com/zzag/plasma5-wallpapers-dynamic

Make sure you set your longitude/latitude correctly as it is not time based.

Clone this repo to /usr/share/dynamicwallpapers/mojave using the command:
`sudo git clone https://github.com/nysascape/mojave-dynamic-wallpaper /usr/share/dynamicwallpapers/mojave`
